# Global COVID 19 Spread and Impact Analysis

## Project Description
This project explores the spread and impact of COVID 19 across different countries and regions. The goal is to visualize infection rates, fatalities, vaccination progress and their socioeconomic implications.

## Data Sources
- **Johns Hopkins University COVID 19 dataset** for cases and deaths.
- **Our World in Data** for vaccinations.
- **World Bank indicators** (GDP, population).

All datasets are regularly updated via automated scripts.

## Analysis Highlights
- **Time series plots** of cases, deaths and vaccinations.
- **Choropleth maps** showing per‑capita infection and mortality rates.
- **Correlation analysis** between public health measures and outcomes.
- **Interactive dashboards** built with Plotly and Dash.

## Results
Our analysis highlights significant regional disparities in infection and mortality rates. Vaccination campaigns correlate strongly with reduced fatalities. The dashboards allow policymakers and researchers to explore trends interactively.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
2. Run `app.py` to launch the dashboard locally.
3. Open your browser at the provided URL to view the interactive dashboards.
